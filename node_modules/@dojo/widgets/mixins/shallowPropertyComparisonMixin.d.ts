 * Mixin that overrides the `processProperties` method providing a comparison of attributes that goes a level deeper for
 * arrays and objects.
 *
 * For Objects, values for all `keys` are compared against the equivalent `key` on the `previousProperties`
 * attribute using `===`. If the `key` does not exists on the `previousProperties` attribute it is considered unequal.
 *
 * For Arrays, each `item` is compared with the `item` in the equivalent `index` of the `previousProperties` attribute.
 * If the `item` is an `object` then the object comparison described above is applied otherwise a simple `===` is used.
